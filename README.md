# webpack-yo-yo

An example of using [yo-yo](https://github.com/maxogden/yo-yo) with
[webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Visit http://localhost:8080

webpack is great for apps but I don't recommend using webpack to create yo-yo
elements. They should always return native DOM elements and not require extra
end user tooling to run/compile.
